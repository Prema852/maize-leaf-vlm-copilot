## 1. Dataset & Classes

The system detects **12 target maize disorders**:

* **Fungal & Bacterial Diseases:** Charcoal Rot, Grey Leaf Spot, Maydis Leaf Blight, Northern Leaf Blight, Common Rust.
* **Insect Pests:** Fall Armyworm, Stem Borer, Thrips.
* **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Zinc (Zn).

## 2. Model Architecture

Instead of monolithic 8B VLMs that cause out-of-memory errors on standard tiers, this pipeline uses a **two-stage hybrid architecture**:

### Why This Hybrid Setup?
* **Google SigLIP Base (Vision):** Provides dense visual token embeddings for detecting both localized lesions and broad chlorotic patterns.
* **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct (Language):** Compact reasoning model (~500M parameters) that operates smoothly on low-memory environments.
* **Agronomic Grounding:** Enforces strict maize-specific pathology protocols to eliminate crop-hallucination errors.
